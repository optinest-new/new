- Track baseline vs. post-launch behavior for this module.

This is where consistency compounds into durable growth for what effective website redesign for consulting firms looks like in practice.

## How to align query intent with page responsibilities (Web Design focus)

Most improvements here come from better sequencing, not from adding more words for how to align query intent with page responsibilities. Small corrections here can produce measurable downstream gains. Within web design operations, this keeps iteration quality consistent.

### Implementation Sequence

1. Define the intent goal for how to align query intent with page responsibilities.
2. Ship a tightly scoped update tied to website redesign for consulting firms.
3. QA for trust, readability, and CTA continuity.
4. Validate movement in scroll completion on decision sections before scaling.
