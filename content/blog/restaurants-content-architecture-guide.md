- **Intent fit:** Does this block answer the expected query stage?
- **Trust signal:** Is evidence specific enough for decision confidence?
- **Action path:** Is the next step clear for the reader?
- **Metric check:** Is scroll completion on decision sections trending in the expected direction?

Treat this section as a controlled experiment, not a broad rewrite task. Monitor scroll completion on decision sections and watch for broad messaging attracting low-fit visitors during review. Within content seo operations, this keeps iteration quality consistent.

### Launch Readiness

- Track baseline vs. post-launch behavior for this module.
- Escalate if quality metrics improve while lead quality declines.
